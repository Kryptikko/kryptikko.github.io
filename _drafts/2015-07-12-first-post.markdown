always wanted to remotely control my torrent client

both require some registration
there must be an easier (read lazy way)

GOAL: run a seeding torrent client with a webinterface
(run an executable and then open a browser window)
turn in on and off
add/downdload new torrents
on bootup lookup for torrent and start seeding
dispaly the list online
make it responseive and pretty
easy deployment (transition from dev to produciton)
ES6(babel support and minifiers)

grunt
babel
