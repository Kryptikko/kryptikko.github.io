Been trying to build a portfolio for a while, to fill that empty github account i got sitting around for a while yet the first step is always the hardest.

I should probably just do some work on open source projects ... food for thout ...

Back to the point ...
Initialy going with what you know best felt the way to go, but as we know if your raiding the web trand waves you can never stay relivant if you stay on one place.

Or can you?

Looking for THAT stack.
-----------------------

In 2015 the dev stacks are build around transpilers, developer "quality of life" tools and leave the production envourment and monitoring to hosting providers.
There are several boilerplate repos (most aimed at ReactJS) out there providing you with most of the "sugar" you need.

- Transpilers (minifier,SASS/LESS,ES6 etc etc)
- Testing
- Easy deployment
- Hot reload

Most of them lack
- in debth logging
- production monitoring

EmberJs
-------

After playing around with gulp and grunt trying to create my own just to get a feel of the tools i ran into Ember agein.

It feels like its always been there, in the background carving its place in the hearts of many while the more agressive comunnities fight over the title of holy gral of javascript (Im looking at you Angular devs). Silently it won over many and grew a community famous for being humane (the rarest of unicorns on the internet).
It kept it self relevant and up to the lastest and hotest althou meybe not the most inovative it stayed stable and relyable.

Althou im yet to explore its logging and production capabilities.

EmberCli
--------

Last i read on it it was hold together by gum and tape (just like its avatar back then). It has come a long way integrating the new cool toys and an a plugin system that seems fairly stable and active.

So Ember the silent winner of the JS frameworks, the king that does not yell "im the king"?

A technology is only as good as its limitations, if you have expirience in expoloring those let me know velin.br.vangelov@gmail.com, since limitatoins and corner cases is rarely the topic let me know.
